Database Management System (DBMS) is software used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.

A database is an organized collection of related data.

A table consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes).

Primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.

Foreign key links one table to another table.

Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

First Normal Form (1NF) removes repeating groups and ensures atomic attributes.

Second Normal Form (2NF) removes partial dependency.

Third Normal Form (3NF) removes transitive dependency.

ACID properties ensure reliable database transactions:
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

Transaction is a logical unit of work performed in a database.
