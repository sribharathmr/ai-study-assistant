Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides services for computer programs.

A process is a program in execution. It contains program code, current activity, memory, and system resources.

Deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by another process.

Four necessary conditions for deadlock:
1. Mutual Exclusion
2. Hold and Wait
3. No Preemption
4. Circular Wait

Deadlock prevention ensures that at least one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot occur.

Deadlock avoidance uses resource allocation information to avoid unsafe states.

Deadlock detection identifies deadlock after it occurs and recovers the system.

CPU scheduling is the method by which the operating system decides which process runs first.

Types of scheduling algorithms include FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin.
