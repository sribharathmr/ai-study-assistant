Deadlock is a situation in operating systems where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for resources held by the others.

Deadlock prevention ensures that at least one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot occur.

Deadlock avoidance requires prior knowledge of resource requirements of processes.
